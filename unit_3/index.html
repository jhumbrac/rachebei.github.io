<p>I'm obsessed with good writing--consuming it, analyzing it, producing it, and then picking it apart to make it better. I'm almost as much of a perfectionist about writing as I am about coffee. (And let's be honest, without copious coffee fueling me, nary a sentence would be written on this page).</p>

<p>As much as quality writing gets me going, though, the real prize is <em>effective</em> writing. That's my goal, and that's what I've dedicated the past decade of my life to mastering. </p>

<p>Here's some of what I do:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ghost writing</li>
		<li>editing and proofreading</li>
		<li>content strategy</li>
		<li>blogging</li>
		<li>caffeine consumption</li>
	</ul>
